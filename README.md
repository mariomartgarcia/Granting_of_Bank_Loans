## Granting of Bank Loans

## Description

The objective of this practice is the cleaning, analysis and representation of a loan dataset. Rstudio programme has been used to obtain conclusions about the mortgage loan applications made to the company Dream Housing Finance. Throughout the practice we will work with the purpose of being able to arrive at a predictive model capable of inferring the state of a loan agreement according to certain input parameters.



## Team members

The activity was carried out jointly by **Germán Yepes Calero** and **Mario Martínez García**.

  &rarr; Code of the final document saved in _.rmd_ format and created in the "Rstudio" platform
                 
**Folder "csv":**

  &rarr; madhantr.csv. It contains the details of a subset of the client loan eligibility process (614 to be exact). Set stipulated as training.
  
  &rarr; madhante.csv. It contains similar information to the previous file but it doesn't reveal the status of the loan for any of the 367 clients. 
  
  &rarr; sample_submission_49d68Cx.csv.  It consists of a single column indicating the status of the loan for clients from the previous file "madhante.csv"
  
In the cleaning section, we worked with a dataset where the three previous archives will be grouped together, generating a more robust dataset.

  &rarr; Loan_clean.csv. Final file obtained after the data cleaning process. This file will be used when analysing the data and will participate in the construction of the predictive model.
